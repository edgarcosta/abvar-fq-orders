The data supporting Section 1.5 and Section 9 is in `data/`

To see how to generate the data, see `code/section9.py`.

We are using 3 methods that find a Weil polynomial of square-free ordinary abelian variety with m points.
1- Verbatim copy of Construction 9.5
2- Do Construction 9.1.
   Take g = hat(h), and let S0 = {g, g^+, g^-} where g^+/- =  g(x) +/- (qx^{n-1} - (q+1)x^n + x^{n+1}).
   Now take S = {h in S0 : h is Weil polynomial and square free}.
   If #{h^[n] % p : h in S} > 1,  deform the middle coefficient of the polynomials in S, and keep the 2 best ones.
   Precisely, we call the function deform_middle_ordinary_squarefree (in `deform.py`):
      Let I_h = {h(1) + c: h(x) + c*x^(degree(h)/2) is a square free Weil polynonial}.
      Given a non-emtpy list S of q-symmetric polynomials such that h(1) = m for h in S,
      we return an interval [l, u] and two polynomials [h0, h1] < S such that:
         - h0, h1 are in S, square free Weil polynomials
         - [l, u] = I_h0 intersection I_h1
         - middle coefficient of h0 and h1 differ modulo p where h0 and h1 were picked such a way that minimizes l.
      If there is no such pair, we return None.

3- Do Construction 9.1 1-3, to compute 1, c_1, ..., c_{n-2}.
    Compute S := {h: h is Weil polynomial, square free, degree(h) = 2*n, (h^[2n - i] = c_i  for i = 1,.., n-2}.
    If #{h^[n] % p : h in S} > 1,  deform the middle coefficient of the polynomials in S, and keep the 2 best ones,
    by calling deform_middle_ordinary_squarefree.

We try to cover the interval [1, end] with the intervals generated by these methods until all fail.
Precisely, by applying them to the input (m,n), where m is the largest integer in [1, end] not yet covered, and with n = floor(log(m)/log(q)) + {1, 0}.
This process ends up failing for small enough m, that we can take care of all the rest with abelian varieties of dimension <= 4.
